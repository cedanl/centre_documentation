## Intro

CEDA stands for Centre for Educational Data Analytics. It is a project within the pilot hub 'Studiedata & AI' (Educational data & AI) of the Npuls programme. ADD_LINK This document is for the basics to get to workin within CEDA. In order to be succinct the document is written in directive language, however, the intention is to support and enable everyone to spend time on the fun things. Many of the guidelines are derived from SURF or the Npuls programme.

## General

-   Working in this project is done through detachment. You get a detachment contract send to you by the HR Support (Flex). For any questions regarding this type of contracts, consult with them.

-   SURF is the lead party of Npuls, therefore, many basics go through SURF environments.

-   When logging into SURF environments, eduVPN is often necessary. Without [eduVPN](https://www.eduvpn.org/), the site seems to be inaccessible. Login in with Institutional access and then SURF.

-   As part of the Npuls program, there is a request to fill in hours via [SAM](https://sam.surf.nl). This is done with your Npuls account.

    -   A link to the guide for keeping track of hours for 2024 ADD_LINK

-   You don't need to use the Npuls account for much else, although you can also have a look at the SURF [intranet](https://surf.sharepoint.com/) or [Confluence](https://confluence.ia.surf.nl/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=NPLSSTAI&title=Npuls+Studiedata+en+Ai+Home).

## Within CEDA

-   We work mainly within an [open source github project](https://github.com/ed2c) where you get write-permissions. Let someone know if you want access on a specific account. (PS: the name ed2c refers to the old working title of ceda).

    -   You can use any local git client, [Smartgit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download) is used by the team at the VU, but [Github Desktop](https://sourceforge.net/software/product/GitHub-Desktop/) and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download) are also used widely. In addition, you can work directly from the command-line with Git.

    -   IDE's often also have a (limited) internal git client.

    -   For guidelines on commits see ways of working ADD_LINK

-   Within the pilot hub Study Data & AI, we keep track of our work on a Kanban Board. For this, as CEDA we have filters for [CEDA](https://jira.ia.surf.nl/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=653&selectedIssue=NPLSSTAI-8&quickFilter=2057) (issues within our project only) and [CEDA only me](https://jira.ia.surf.nl/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=653&quickFilter=2058) (my issues only).

    -   For guidelines of the usage of the Kanboard board, see ways of working ADD_LINK

## Collaboration

-   Everyone has a sub-project where that person is in the lead. However, as you know, team work makes a dream work so collaboration / meeting across sub-projects are encouraged. In addition, you could benefit to CEDA as a whole.

-   Asynchronous contact with each other within the project is in the pilot hub done via Teams

    -   QUESTION: Should we use this as well? Or something else?

-   1-on-1 meetings with the project lead bi-weekly half an hour

-   QUESTION: How often do we see each other and for how long? Every month (half) a day in Utrecht? Six weeks?

-   QUESTION: Whatsapp / Signal group for random stuff?

## First Steps

-   See the ways-of-working document for the general expectations. Since we work agile there is no need to plan your whole project in detail.

    -   SUGGESTION: make a document of max 1 A4 with bullets of the minimum viable product you want to achieve in your project the coming 6 months

        -   Define three 'stories' (a story is approximately a day work) with the specific first steps you want to take

-   In addition, not everything has to be done (good). The most important 'business' goal is to get stuff working and share this with other data professionals in education.

-   The data engineering and the centre are not that crystallized yet, but individual members can also define first steps and general mvp for comings six months.

-   QUESTION: We need to have a kick-off of some sort. However, we are still in the hiring process, so it not yet clear how we can invite. Maybe the 'kick-off' after the first month? So end of February, start of March?
